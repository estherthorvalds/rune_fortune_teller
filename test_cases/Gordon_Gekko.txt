Diary — Night Before the Speech

Tomorrow I walk into that lecture hall and tell a room full of bright-eyed, overeducated optimists the truth — the truth no one ever wants to say out loud. They’ll sit there, pens ready, hair neatly parted, waiting to be inspired. And I will oblige them. But inspiration is a side effect. Clarity is the drug.

I can already see their faces: half of them hungry for the gospel, the other half pretending they’re above it. But every single one of them wants the same thing — a guarantee that if they play the game right, they’ll win. They won’t get that guarantee from me. I don’t deal in fairy tales. I deal in reality. And the reality is simple: the world belongs to people who take it.

Tonight, as I prepare, I can’t help replaying the last decade — the brokers I’ve outmaneuvered, the deals that died on the conference table, the ones that snapped to life because I pushed them harder than anyone else would. The market is a living organism: it breathes, it thrashes, it rewards the bold and devours the slow. I didn’t make the rules. I just bothered to understand them.

I’m not nervous about the speech. Nervous men lose. What I am is… sharpened. Focused. Like a blade dragged over stone. They’ll quote me for decades if I deliver this correctly. And I will. I always do.

I ran the phrasing again tonight, pacing the apartment. There’s a rhythm to it — persuasion is a performance, and I’m not ashamed to admit I enjoy that part. “Greed” — the word still hums with power. People fear it, resent it, crave it, deny it, moralize it. It scares them because it exposes what they truly want.

I’ll tell them tomorrow that greed is good. Greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, captures the essence of evolutionary spirit. And the beauty is, it’s true. It has always been true. The economy is not saved by saints. It is driven by individuals who dare to want more — more efficiency, more innovation, more control, more profit.

I know there will be critics. There always are. They’ll say I’m poisoning the youth, glamorizing avarice, encouraging sin. But these are the same people who invest quietly, hide their ambitions under soft language, and pretend their tax shelters are moral choices. Hypocrisy is the most common currency in America. Greed is just the honest one.

Tonight I checked the markets before bed — a ritual, a reminder. Futures look uncertain, volatility creeping in. Good. Volatility is opportunity wearing a mask. I hope it spikes tomorrow. It will make every word I say land twice as hard.

I can feel the weight of what tomorrow could be. This isn’t just a speech. It’s a thesis. A manifesto. A scalpel slicing through the polite fiction that mediocrity deserves reward.

Tomorrow, I tell the world a secret it already knows:
There is no shame in wanting.
There is only shame in pretending you don’t.
