Christ, what a day. I swear, every time I think I’ve seen the peak — the absolute summit of chaos, adrenaline, and unfiltered human insanity — the universe pours me another shot and says, “Here, try this, champ.”

I walked onto the trading floor this morning and the place was already vibrating. Not buzzing — vibrating. A thousand phones ringing, brokers screaming numbers like battle cries, paper everywhere like confetti from the parade we hadn’t thrown yet. Someone had the audacity to ask me if I’d had breakfast. Breakfast? Buddy, I’ve been eating fear and market volatility since 6 a.m.

We were running hot on a new issue. Too hot. The kind of heat that makes you question whether the fire is lighting the rocket or burning down the whole damn building. And I loved it. Every second. I could practically taste the dollar signs.

By noon, we were up enough to make God lean over the clouds and take notes. I gave a pep talk — the kind where half the room is laughing, half is crying, and everyone is foaming at the mouth with the kind of religious fervor only money can inspire. I swear, for a moment, I saw a guy look at me like I was the second coming. Probably unhealthy. But flattering.

Then the afternoon hit. The market started wobbling — not crashing, not tanking, just wobbling, like it had one too many martinis. Which, come to think of it, made sense, because half the traders looked like they’d had three. I kept the energy up, kept the boys from spiraling, kept the ship from capsizing. Fear is contagious, but so is confidence, and I’ve never been short on confidence.

I closed two deals myself just for the sport of it. Didn’t need to. Just wanted to feel the rush. Nothing — and I mean nothing — hits like that moment when the wire clears and you realize you just turned thin air into money.

After the close, I sat in my office with my feet on the desk, watching the last light hit the skyline. And for a second — just a second — I let myself breathe. It’s easy to forget, when the whole world is shouting your name, that the noise can swallow you if you stop moving.

Some people chase peace. Serenity. Soft pillows and quiet weekends. I chase the pulse — the heartbeat of the market, the thrill in the pit of my stomach when the numbers roll in and I know I’ve won. Again.

Tonight the city feels electric, like it knows we took it for a ride today. I should probably sleep. But who am I kidding? I’m already thinking about tomorrow. About the next trade, the next surge, the next hit of pure, uncut adrenaline that keeps me doing this crazy dance.

Wall Street doesn’t rest.
So neither do I.
