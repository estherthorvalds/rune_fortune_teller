Diary Entry — Late Night, On-Call Room

I keep telling myself that if I say it clinically enough, maybe it will stop hurting. That if I package it in medical terminology — wrap it in the sterile language of trauma bays and morbidity reports — the grief will behave. But grief has never respected the rules of triage.

Derek is dead. And my mind keeps circling the same question: whose fault is it?

I shouldn’t ask. I know better. I teach my residents not to swim in the what-ifs. But I’m not Chief tonight. I’m not a surgeon tonight. I’m not “Grey” in the way they say it in hallways, with awe or fear or exasperation. I’m just a widow with a racing heart and a brain that won’t stop replaying the timeline like a malfunctioning CT scanner.

Was it the first hospital? The one that didn’t have a trauma surgeon on-site, the one that didn’t activate a neuro consult until it was already too late? The one that intubated him too slow, placed an ICP monitor too late, missed the herniation signs because they were “busy”?

Part of me wants to scream that it was them — their delay, their oversight, their failure to follow basic ATLS protocol. ABCs. Airway, breathing, circulation. Textbook.

But then the other voice — the darker one — whispers:
You knew he shouldn’t have been on that road.
You knew he was exhausted.
You didn’t make him stay.

And then there’s the ugliest thought of all:
What if it was fate?
What if it was just the universe being the universe — random, merciless, unteachable?

Doctors hate randomness. We live in patterns, in labs, in imaging, in differential diagnoses. We believe every event has a cause, that every death has a node on a flow chart leading to something preventable. Otherwise how could we stand in front of a patient’s family and promise we fought for them?

But tonight, in this empty room that smells faintly of bleach and adrenaline, I’m forced to admit the truth that medicine tries so hard to pretend isn’t real:
Sometimes people die because life is fragile, not because someone is to blame.

Still, my hands keep shaking. I keep imagining Derek lying there, alone, waiting for a competent surgeon who never came, and the guilt hits me like a sternal rub — sharp, deliberate, cruel.

He saved lives every day. He deserved better.
He deserved me there.
He deserved a fighting chance.

I’ve spent years telling other people’s families to take things “one day at a time.” I’ve never hated a phrase more.

There’s no protocol for this. No residents to bark orders at. No OR to disappear into. No checklist for surviving the loss of the person who made your world make sense.

I keep wondering whose fault it was — but the truth is, even if I had the answer, it wouldn’t change a damn thing.

He’s still gone.
And I’m still here, writing into a void, trying not to drown.
