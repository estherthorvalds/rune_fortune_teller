This eve, beneath pale Luna’s watchful eye, I set quill to parchment, for mine heart swelleth with such tumult that silence might well undo me. Verona sleepeth, yet I, poor wretch, do toss in fevered thought, caught betwixt duty and desire, honor and the sweet, consuming fire of love.

O cruel fate! By what enchantment doth one glance of a maiden’s eye unravel all the careful stitching of a life? Ere I beheld fair Juliet, I fancied myself heart-sore for Rosaline. Ha! A childish infatuation, mere shadow-play upon the wall. But with Juliet — aye, with her — the very air I breathe is changed. She doth command the heavens themselves, and all my stars conspire to summon me unto her.

Yet mine house and hers, like ancient lions, snarl across the city streets. Were our families but made of wax, they would melt before the heat of such affection as burneth in me. But they are forged of iron, and iron is a jealous metal.

This night, I did steal into her father’s orchard. I know well how rash a trespass it was, yet my feet moved with such purpose that fear itself could scarce keep pace. There she stood—O miracle!—upon her balcony, fairer than dawn brushing its golden fingers across the hills. Her words, unmeant for mortal ears, drifted to me like sacred hymns, confessing love to the very night. Would that I had wings; I would have flown to her side.

When I made myself known, her cheek did flush like the blush of a newborn rose. And though she spoke of prudence and the danger that circleth us like wolves, still she gave her heart into my keeping. A ring of sweetness in her voice, a tremble soft as the rustle of an angel’s wing — such music could command the tides themselves.

But now, alone, mine elation is mingled with dread. For what future doth await us? A Montague and a Capulet, bound by affection yet sundered by ancient spite? Methinks even the gods would tremble to unwind such knots. And yet… love, bold love, doth whisper unto me that all may be well. That some secret path lies hidden, awaiting only our courage to walk it.

If peril be the price of joy, gladly do I hazard it. Juliet’s love is a lantern in the dark, and where it leadeth, there shall I follow. I know not what storms tomorrow may bring—whether peace or the sword—but this alone is truth: my heart is hers, wholly and forever.

O sweet Juliet! Were words not so poor a vessel, I would summon the very firmament to sing thy praise. Till dawn doth break, I cling to hope, and pray that fortune, long my foe, may at last grow gentle.

Thus endeth this night’s confession, writ by a soul both fevered and blessed.
