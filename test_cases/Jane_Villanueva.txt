Diary Entry — Late Evening, Abuela’s Kitchen Table

I keep thinking that if I write this down, it will somehow make more sense — or at least feel less like my whole world is tilting. But the words are sticking to my throat the same way they stuck there earlier when the doctor said “biopsy” and “suspicious mass” and “we can’t rule anything out yet.”

My mother. My loud, glittery, unstoppable mother.
Cancer.
I can’t even write the words next to each other without feeling like I’m betraying her somehow.

The minute we got home, she started making jokes — of course she did. “At least my boobs have always been fabulous, so if one’s trying to kill me, it makes sense.” She laughed like it was just another telenovela twist, like the writers were getting bored and needed some new drama. And for a second, I laughed too because that’s what we do in this family: we laugh in the face of fear until we can breathe again.

But then she went to her room, closed the door, and I heard her crying. Quietly. My mother does nothing quietly. It broke something in me.

I know the statistics. I know the survival rates. I know that early detection is everything. I know not to catastrophize. I know, I know, I know—
But knowledge isn’t armor.
And I’m terrified.

I keep imagining life without her and immediately shutting the thought down because no — just no. That’s not a plotline I am willing to entertain. My mother has been the sun of my entire life. The force I orbit. The reason I believe in love and romance and melodrama and happy endings. She’s supposed to live forever, wearing leopard print and giving unsolicited advice and embarrassing me in front of my child.

She can’t be sick. She just can’t.

Abuela says God will protect her. She said it with that calm, unshakeable faith she always has. She lit candles. She stroked my hair. She reminded me that Villanuevas are fighters. I nodded and pretended it helped, but the truth is, faith feels like a thin blanket on a very cold night.

Mom asked me tonight, “Are you scared?”
I lied. I said no.
Because she looked at me with those big brown eyes — the same eyes I have — and she needed strength, not honesty.

But here, in these pages, I can admit it:
I am scared.
I am so scared.

Still… in the middle of all this fear, there’s something else, too. Something stubborn. A spark. She has survived everything life has thrown at her — heartbreak, poverty, raising me on her own, Petra (which should count twice), every disaster our telenovela-writer universe has tossed into the plot. She is Xiomara Villanueva. She is fire.

And tomorrow we’ll face the results together.
No matter what they say, we will fight.
Because that’s what Villanuevas do.
